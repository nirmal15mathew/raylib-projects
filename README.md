### Conway's Game of life

It is a zero player game designed by Mathematician John Conway which shows a turing complete machine that shows that life can be formed from simple rules.
The rules of conway's game of life are
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
